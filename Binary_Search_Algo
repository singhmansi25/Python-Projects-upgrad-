# Binary Search Algorithm
Have you ever heard the proverb, “finding a needle in a haystack.” This program is designed to do just that- by using a binary search algorithm. 

This python project idea will help you create and implement an algorithm that searches for an element in a list. 

In a nutshell, this search algorithm takes advantage of a collection of elements that is already sorted by ignoring half of the elements after just one comparison. 


## Problem Statement:
- You have to create a list of random numbers between 0 to 100, with every succeeding number having a difference of 2 between them.

- When the user inputs a random number, the program will check if that number is included in the list. It will do so by creating two halves of the list. 

- If the program finds the number in the first half of the list, it will eliminate the other half and vice versa. 

- The search will continue until the program finds the number input of the user or until the subarray size becomes 0 (this means that the number is not in the list). 


## Tasks:
- Take a number x between 0 to 100 as an input from user.

- Compare x with the middle element.

- If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index.

- Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half.

- Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half.
