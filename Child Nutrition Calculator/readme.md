## Problem Statement:
As a childcare provider, we have an essential role in
childrenâ€™s lives by helping them learn and grow. You
help children get the nourishment and energy they
need to learn and grow by providing healthy meals.

Also, keep in mind that preschoolers who eat a variety
of healthy foods and play actively several times every
day are less likely to be overweight or obese.

Create a child nutrition calculator based on the
following rules:

â€¢ Calculator should be able to store the details of
the child such as the name, age, gender, height
and weight.

â€¢ Calculate the BMI of the child using the standard
BMI formula.

â€¢ Display the minimum daily calorie requirement
based on the age. Use the below criteria to display
the same:

ðŸŒŸ Age b/w 0-2 years: 800 calories

ðŸŒŸ Age b/w 2-4 years: 1400 calories

ðŸŒŸ Age b/w 4-8 years: 1800 calories

Take as input what that child has eaten
throughout the day and in what quantities.

â€¢ Calculate the daily calorie consumption based on
the following criteria:

- Milk: 100 cal/ 100g 
- Egg: 155 cal/ 100g 
- Rice: 130 cal/ 100g 
- Lentils: 113 cal/ 100g 
- Vegetable: 85 cal/100g 
- Meat: 143 cal/ 100g

â€¢ Next, compare the daily consumption with the
recommended value and print if the child is under-nourished or not.

## Test Case:
- Input:
Name: Peter Parker

Age: 7

Gender - M

Height: 1.143 m

Weight: 21.22 kgs

- Calorie Consumption: 

Milk: 300g

Vegetables: 300g

Meat: 200g

Lentils: 100g

Egg: 300g

Rice: 300g
### Output:
BMI of Peter Parker is 20.82 and he (she) is
healthy.

The daily calorie consumption of Peter Parker
is 1809 and he (she) is not undernourished.
